## Summary

This is a guide for anyone who wants to understand or edit these files.

<br/>

## Markdown Files

<br/>

### slides.md

This is the file that contains the final slides content.
When using HackMD and pulling from GitHub to generate the slides, pull this file as is.

<br/>

### slides_end_of_session.md

This file contains a simple section saying 'End Of Session', which is automatically added after the last slide from each session.

<br/>

### slides_header.md

This file contains two sections:

- A YAML header.
- An HTML/CSS <style> section.

<br/>

The YAML header carries information regarding:

- The title of the HTML document that will be generated by HackMD (this will be reflected as the title of the slides page that opens on your web browser).
- The theme of the slides (which mostly affects the background color). Do note that, if there is a background image, it will sit on top of the original background.

<br/>

The HTML/CSS <style> section carries information regarding:
  
- The font size of the whole slide presentation.
- The background for the whole slide presentation. In this case, it features an address that is recognised by HackMD as a reference to an image, which happens to be a white background with an **Elixir** logo on the bottom left. The background is set to cover each slide entorely.
