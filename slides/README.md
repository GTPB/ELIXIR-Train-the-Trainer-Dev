## Summary

This is a guide for anyone who wants to edit these episodes. The reason for having such a guide is that, unlike many simpler repositories, the episode files in this folder might undergo some extra automatic transformations after each edit/commit. They are also meant to be used both by GitHub Pages and HackMD, which requires some extra care with the formatting.
