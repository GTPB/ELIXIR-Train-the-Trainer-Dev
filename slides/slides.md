### Learning principles

<br/>

- Episode description
    - Objectives:
    - Learning outcomes:
- Topics
    - 7 evidence-based learning principles
- Challenges
    - What is your understanding of these learning principles?

---

### 7 Evidence-based Learning Principles

<br/>

- Principle P1: Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

- Principle P2: How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

- Principle P3: Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn

---

- Principle P4: To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned

- Principle P5: Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of sudents' learning

---

- Principle P6: Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning

- Principle P7: To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.

### Challenge 4 - What is your understanding of these learning principles?
- Work in groups of three
- Carefully read the principles as a group
- Pick one principle you like (with no overlap with the other groups)
- Discuss what you would do as a teacher/instructor to facilitate learning according to the principle

---

### Challenge 5 - what is your understanding of these learning principles?
#### Example
Principle 2: How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

---

Possible teaching practices  

- Teach learners how to build and use concept maps
- Provide learners with a scheme and show them how every new concept/fact fits into the scheme
- Every time a new concept/fact is introduced, explain how it fits into the general picture

---

## Challenge 6 - Motivation
  
Think about a motivating experience in your life (as a student or as an instructor/teacher) and share it in the GDoc.

---

---

## Value
- Attainment value
  - Satisfaction that one gains from mastery and accomplishment of a goal or task 
- Intrinsic value
  - The satisfaction that one gains simply from doing the task rather than from a particular outcome of the task
  - It is the source of intrinsic motivation
  
---  
  
- Instrumental value/extrinsic rewards 
  - Praise
  - Public recognition
  - Money
  - Material goods
  - An interesting career
  - A high-status job, etc.) 

---

## Efficacy
- Positive outcomes expectancies for success
- Growth vs fixed mindset  
- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997). 
- Positive outcomes expectancies for success
- Growth vs fixed mindset

---

- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997). 
- In order to hold a positive expectancy for success, learners must not only believe that doing the assigned work can earn a passing grade (growth mindset), they must also believe that they are capable of doing the work necessary to earn a passing grade

---

## Environment
- Complex dynamics of the classroom 
- The tone of the classroom 
- The interpersonal forces at play 
- The nature and structure of communication patterns. 
- E.g. "The instructor is approachable and several of my classmates seem willing to help me if I run into troubles". 
- inclusivity

---

## Challenge 7 - What can I do to create a motivating environment?
Think, pair, share  
In pairs, think about what you could do to create a motivating environment in your classroom. 
Share it with us.

---

## Strategies to motivate learners
- Connect the material to students’ interests
- Provide authentic, real-world tasks/example
- Show relevance to students’ current academic lives
- Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students’ future professional lives
- Identify and reward what you value
- Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline
- Build positive expectations

---

- Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies
- Identify an appropriate level of challenge
- Provide early success opportunities
- Articulate your expectations
- Provide targeted feedback
- Be fair
- Describe effective study strategies
- Give students an opportunity to reflect

---

## Challenge 8 - Demotivation
Think about a demotivating experience in your life (as a student or as an instructor/teacher) and share it to the GDoc.

---

## Demotivating
Do not
- Dive into complex or detailed technical discussions with one or two people
- Pretend to know more than what you do
- Use diminishing language "just", "simply", "obviously", "don’t you know?"
- Hinder autonomy
- Deliver long unidirectional lectures

## Different ways to categorize assessment

![](https://i.imgur.com/w15CD4A.png)

---

## Fist of five feedback

![](https://i.imgur.com/W1JyGUz.png)

---

## Formative assessment should be frequent

- Ideally every 5 min
- At least gni 10-15 min
- Attention span: 10-15 min 
- Refocus attention

![](https://i.imgur.com/bvNsKj0.png)

---

### Systematic immediate feedback

- When?
  - Ideally at natural breakpoints such as ending an exercise, shifting to a different subject and right after a wrap-up session.
- How?
  - It should be very focused and expedite in execution. The instructor should think of a clearly stated question that has a binary (Yes/no) or garaded (0-5) response.
  
This is Instant Feedback.

---

### Feedback from learners

- Assessing learner reactions to teachers and teaching thus providing context-specific feedback that can improve teaching within a particular course.
- Assessing learner reactions to class activities, assignments, and materials thus giving instructors information that will help them improve their course materials and assignments.
- Assessing learner reactions to course organisational aspects, thus providing the organiser information that will help him or her to improve the course organisation;

## Feedback is hard

![](https://i.imgur.com/d6WF7T7.png)

---

### Dealing with (bad) feedback

Trainees feedback should be considered along other forms of quality evidence:
- Review what they have effectively learned (in exams)
- Consider your own experience of teaching
- Discuss with colleagues and friends
- Look at the feedback from past sessions of the same course
- Look at the response rates
- Look at the counter examples (contradictions)
- Look at the repetitive patterns (not at only one single answer)
- Breathe deeply
- Humans focus more on negative feedback than on positive (you are not alone)
- Try to see the point in the criticism, learn from it
- Don’t take it personally (easier said than done). Try to focus on what they say about what you do (not who you are)

---

### Learn and teach others how to give good feedback
