### 7 Evidence-based Learning Principles

<br/>

- Principle P1: Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

- Principle P2: How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

- Principle P3: Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn

---

- Principle P4: To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned

- Principle P5: Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of sudents' learning

---

- Principle P6: Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning

- Principle P7: To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.

---

### Challenge 4 - What is your understanding of the principles of learning (10 min)?
