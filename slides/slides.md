## 7 evidence-based learning principles

#### Principle P1:
Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

#### Principle P2:
How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

#### Principle P3:
Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn.

#### Principle P4:
To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.

---

#### Principle P5:
Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning.

#### Principle P6:
Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.

#### Principle P7:
To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.

## How does learning progress?

![](https://i.imgur.com/0LidygS.png)

---

## Bloom's taxonomy

---

### Bloom's six categories of cognitive skills

![](https://i.imgur.com/M4xZHFQ.png)

---

### Using Bloom's taxonomy

- Bloom's taxonomy can be helpful in aligning the training with the learners' level of thinking (complexity, experience, etc).

- In practice, Bloom's level of cognitive complexity can be used to:
  - Write learning outcomes (LOs)
  - Design instruction and learning experiences
  - Assess learning

---

## Instruction design in five steps

![](https://i.imgur.com/hrnfYMk.png)

---

## Learning outcomes (LOs)

- LOs (more accurately “desired LOs”) are statements of what you might (in principle) assess. 

- You may not end up assessing all of them, but they are statements of what a successful* student will know or be able to do at the end of instruction.

- By the end of the lesson (session/course/instruction) the successful learner will be able to.........

---

![](https://i.imgur.com/WvwHoQO.png)

---

### Writing learning outcomes using assessable verbs

<br/>

1. Think about what learners will be able to do by the end of instruction
2. Use the sentence:
    - By the end of the lesson (session/course/instruction) the successful learner will be able to......... 
3. Replace dots with a verb that you can assess (name, explain, solve, distinguish, etc.).
4. Avoid verbs that are open to many interpretations: e.g., appreciate, have faith in, know, learn, understand, believe

---

## Challenge: How do I write LOs?

1. Think of a lesson/session you usually deliver 
2. Write one or more Learning Outcomes for the lesson/session
3. Write to the GDoc the title of the lesson/session and the corresponding LO(s)

---

![](https://i.imgur.com/mCRBRqu.png)

---

## Challenge: Short-term memory

How many words do you remember?

---

## Challenge: Willigham (2009)

How many consecutive letters can you remember? Write them down.

- XCN
- NPH
- DFB
- ICI
- ANC
- AAX

---

What about now?

- X
- CNN
- PHD
- FBI
- CIA
- NCAA
- X

---


## What can we do to make more room in working memory?

- Chunking
- Increase background knowledge
- Avoid extraneous cognitive load

---

## Increasing background knowledge

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZpsI8UM.png)


Principle **P1**: Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

---

## How does learning progress?

---

### The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition

![](https://i.imgur.com/83hHqVL.png)

---

### The Carpentries model of skill acquisition

![](https://i.imgur.com/MqtFAuL.png)

---

## Mental models

Mental model - A collection of concepts and facts, along with the relationships between those concepts, that a person has about a topic or field.

![](https://i.imgur.com/LcX3r2T.png)

---


Example: mental model of DNA

![](https://i.imgur.com/J8nGdnt.png)

---


### Novice vs Competent Practitioner vs Expert

A novice, typically has not yet built a mental model of the field.

A competent practitioner has a mental model that works for many purposes, but will not be very accurate.

Experts’ mental models are much more densely connected. Therefore they can jump directly from a problem to its solution because there is a direct link between the two in their mind.

---

## What facilitates learning?

- It is not only a matter of knowledge
- Help novices build a mental model
- Help learners make connections
- Detect and remedy misconceptions
- Be aware of the limitations of expertise
  - Expert blind spot
  - Fluid representations
  
---
  
### Three classes of misconceptions

1. **Simple factual errors**: These are the easiest to correct.

2. **Broken models**: We can address these by having learners reason through examples to see contradictions.

3. **Fundamental beliefs**: These beliefs are deeply connected to the learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change.

---

### Cognitive load

1. **Intrinsic cognitive load** is the effort associated with a specific topic.

2. **Germane cognitive load** it is the (desirable) mental effort required to create linkages between new information and old.

2. **Extraneous cognitive load** is everything else that distracts or gets in the way. Extraneous cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner.

---

### Attention split effect

![](https://i.imgur.com/GvMRzj7.png)

Split-attention occurs when learners are required to split their attention between at least two sources of information that have been separated either spatially or temporally.

---


![](https://i.imgur.com/xNVGiL2.png)

---

![](https://i.imgur.com/aEfW2Mb.png)

---

## Challenge: Extraneous cognitive load (10 min)

- Think of the tasks you teach in your lessons/courses. Pick one.

- What would be the extraneous load in performing this task. How can you avoid it?

- Discuss with your partner(s).

---

### Possible teaching practices  

- Teach learners how to build and use concept maps
- Provide learners with a scheme and show them how every new concept/fact fits into the scheme
- Every time a new concept/fact is introduced, explain how it fits into the general picture

---

## Challenge 6 - Motivation
  
Think about a motivating experience in your life (as a student or as an instructor/teacher) and share it in the GDoc.

---

![](https://i.imgur.com/fZVxchj.png)

---

## Value

- Attainment value
  - Satisfaction that one gains from mastery and accomplishment of a goal or task 
- Intrinsic value
  - The satisfaction that one gains simply from doing the task rather than from a particular outcome of the task
  - It is the source of intrinsic motivation
  
---  
  
- Instrumental value/extrinsic rewards 
  - Praise
  - Public recognition
  - Money
  - Material goods
  - An interesting career
  - A high-status job, etc 

---

## Efficacy
- Positive outcomes expectancies for success
- Growth vs fixed mindset  
- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997). 
- Positive outcomes expectancies for success
- Growth vs fixed mindset

---

- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997). 
- In order to hold a positive expectancy for success, learners must not only believe that doing the assigned work can earn a passing grade (growth mindset), they must also believe that they are capable of doing the work necessary to earn a passing grade

---

## Environment
- Complex dynamics of the classroom 
- The tone of the classroom 
- The interpersonal forces at play 
- The nature and structure of communication patterns. 
- E.g. "The instructor is approachable and several of my classmates seem willing to help me if I run into troubles". 
- inclusivity

---

## Challenge 7 - What can I do to create a motivating environment?
Think, pair, share  
In pairs, think about what you could do to create a motivating environment in your classroom. 
Share it with us.

---

## Strategies to motivate learners
- Connect the material to students’ interests
- Provide authentic, real-world tasks/example
- Show relevance to students’ current academic lives
- Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students’ future professional lives
- Identify and reward what you value
- Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline
- Build positive expectations

---

- Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies
- Identify an appropriate level of challenge
- Provide early success opportunities
- Articulate your expectations
- Provide targeted feedback
- Be fair
- Describe effective study strategies
- Give students an opportunity to reflect

---

## Challenge 8 - Demotivation
Think about a demotivating experience in your life (as a student or as an instructor/teacher) and share it to the GDoc.

---

## Demotivating
Do not
- Dive into complex or detailed technical discussions with one or two people
- Pretend to know more than what you do
- Use diminishing language "just", "simply", "obviously", "don’t you know?"
- Hinder autonomy
- Deliver long unidirectional lectures

---

## Active learning
Learners who actively engage with course materials will end up retaining it for much longer than they would have otherwise, and they will be better able to apply their knowledge broadly.

_Waldrop, Nature 2015_

![](https://i.imgur.com/0HVvM9B.png)

---

## Interactive learning
- Participatory engagement 
- Promotes retention
- Develops critical thinking
- Allows you to assess learners
- Learners immediately apply content

Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College (SERC):
https://serc.carleton.edu/sp/library/interactive/

---

## Strategies for active, interactive, collaborative learning
- Brief question-and-answer sessions 
- Think, pair, share

- Introduce blended multimedia materials
- Instant feedback
- Let learners do recaps
- Introduce physical exercises
- Introduce short, relaxing breaks
- Assign tasks/problems to groups/pairs, giving them time to present their results
- Introduce challenges or games

---

## Activities and attitudes the instructor should promote
- Listening

- Providing answers before letting participants doing it
- Keeping the same pace for long time
- Using a monotone modality of content delivery (including the tone of the voice)
- Showing no enthusiasm

---

## Technique - Wrap-up
Allow time for wrap up and feedback

---

## Challenge 9
On the GDoc
 
One or more new things that you have learned today and could be useful for your future teaching/training

---

## Challenge 10 - your vote counts
Add a + sign next to the point you agree the most

:D - Great I feel I’m learning new things  
:] - I feel neutral, maybe I need more time to reflect  
:S - I am more confused then ever

---

## Technique - Short feedback
- Sticky notes: red and green
- Minute cards: positive and negative (anonymous)
- One up, one down: positive and negative (no repetition)

---

## Challenge 11 - One up one down
1. Something you liked about what you did (do this again!)
2. Something you would like to change (avoid next time)

[Ambrose, Susan A., et al. How Learning Works, John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated, 2010](https://extend.ecampusontario.ca/teacher-for-learning-how-learning-works/)

---

1. Prior knowledge
2. Knowledge organisation
3. Motivation
4. Mastery: acquisition, practice integration, application
5. Goal directed practice with targeted feedback
6. Environment: social, emotional, and intellectual 
7. Self-directed learners: learn, monitor, adjust

---

## Strategies applied to learning principles
1. Collect data about students and use it to design instruction (P1,P3). Be aware and make people aware of diversity in the classroom.

2. Be explicit about learning goals, learning objectives and expectations (P3, P5, P6). Goals challenging but attainable.

3. Scaffold complex tasks (P2-P7). Teach and test at the right level, think about your audience.

---

4. Let learners formulate solutions before moving to work on new problems. Have them reflect on what they learned, and what they will do differently in the future (P2, P4, P7).

5. Establish a supportive class climate (P3, P6). Learn and use learners' names and encourage them to interact with you in and outside of the course. Collect anonymous learner feedback and investigate and respond to any complaints related to class climate.

## Concept maps - How to use the tool
- Concept maps are graphical tools for organizing and representing knowledge
- Include concepts and relationships to link concepts
- Good to start a concept map with a focus question - context
- Help to organize knowledge and to structure it
- Good concept maps are built with iterations and feedback

_Joseph D. Novak , 1972_

---

## Concept maps in curriculum/lesson/session planning
- They present key concepts in a highly concise manner
- This helps us predict how much we can cover when designing the teaching plan
- The hierarchical organization suggests a sequence to cover material

Further reading [http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.pdf](http://cmap.ihmc.us/Publications/ResearchPapers/TheoryUnderlyingConceptMaps.pdf)

---

## Challenge: Draw a concept map (10 min)

Draw a concept map of your topic of interest, start with a question

- Include around 7 (plus or minus 2) concepts
- Include relationships and cross-links between these concepts
- Arrange it in a hierarchical structure with the key concepts on top

---

## Challenge: Feedback on concept maps (8 min)

In a group of 2 exchange concept maps. Do not explain the map.

- Write one thing you are confused/not sure about the map

7. Then rotate within the group (and restart from 1)

---

How to give feedback?

---

## Constructive feedback

![](https://i.imgur.com/acCvWYw.png)

---

## Discussions/feedback

- Listen actively and attentively
- Ask for clarification if you are confused
- Do not interrupt one another
- Challenge one another, but do so respectfully
- Criticize ideas, not people
- Do not offer opinions without supporting evidence
- Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion
- Build on one another ’s comments; work toward shared understanding.
- Do not monopolise discussion.
- Speak from your own experience, without generalizing.
- If you are offended by anything said during discussion, acknowledge it immediately.

## Challenge: Create lesson plan

In your group...
- Take one session idea and expand to a “real” training session
- You will need to:
- Identify target audience
- Set learning objectives and outcomes
- Decide learning experiences
- Suggest how you will assess trainees progress
Define training session structure/lesson plan (including indicative content, length, breakdown and timings)

---

## Delivery planning

- Is it part of an extended curriculum?
- Is the training a requirement, or optional career development?
- Format: workshop, seminar, lecture, online training or mix online/in-person?
- Timing: what is the content and depth of the training?
- Do you need to invite any other external experts? 
- What sort of venue/equipment do you need for this format?

---

## From session to course – defining the aim

- Combine the who, what and why requirements into a course aim
  - Who: write clear trainee specifications; e.g. undergraduate biologists with basic knowledge of Unix and R
  - What & why: describe what trainees will learn, and the benefit of that
- Consider the where and when requirements (i.e. the logistics)
  - How much can you do in the time available (including tests, feedback)
  - Resources limitations (space, equipment, assistants)

## From learning outcomes to a course outline

- A well-written course aim will guide the generation of LOs

![](https://i.imgur.com/piDsVEW.png)

- LOs should then be instantiated as activities and quality checks
  - Learning activities: scripts, slides, exercises, tutorials, …
  - Assessment tools: creative activities, written tests, …
  - Feedback tools: observation, interaction, forms, …
- Learning activities (LAs) should be tightly-linked to quality checks
  - This is not ‘teaching to the test’ because it’s training not education
- When all the LOs are expanded, you have your course outline

## Reproducibility of compute environments

- Different courses, different compute requirements: Unix, R, Python, metagenomics, long read sequencing
- Installation process time-consuming and technically challenging
- Every computer should have an identical installation setup and sufficient hardware (power and memory) to run the tools 
- Virtual machines, cloud computing, containers, software images

---

## Training rooms for bioinformatics

Physical environment 
- Room geometry: seats’ quality, the lighting, the room temperature control, the stability of power and network connections
- Functionality : video, audio, drawing surfaces (whiteboard, flipchart paper), a corkboard  to pin materials 
- Hardware needs: power suppliers, network connections with a good quality wifi access

---

## Training materials: sharing and making re-use possible

Learning outcome: Be able to identify training materials that exist already, and develop a routine of sharing training materials.

---

## FAIR principles

Data and models are:
- Findable - can be searched for by the community after publication
- Accessible - can be read/downloaded by other researchers
- Interoperable - can be understood clearly in the context of the original experiment
- Re-usable - can be used by other researchers

---

### FAIR principles – In the context of training

Training course materials: slides, exercises, datasets
- Findable - can be searched and found by the trainers community
- Accessible - can be read/downloaded by other trainers
- Interoperable - can be understood clearly in the context of the original course
- Re-usable - can be used by other trainers

## Different ways to categorize assessment

![](https://i.imgur.com/w15CD4A.png)

---

## Pre-course assessment - Diagnostic questionnaires

- Anonymous questionnaires allow us to have an idea of the level of knowledge of the whole group of learners.

- Non-anonymous and personal questionnaires allow us to find out if the learner has a necessary pre-required knowledge, and in the negative case indicate an appropriate teaching choice to palliate this lack.

---

## Challenge 1 - Who would feel comfortable with giving a definition of "formative assessment"? (5 min)

## The purpose of formative assessment

![](https://i.imgur.com/2APHMT4.png)

---

### Formative assessment can be used to collect information about learners'
- goals and objectives
  - Are learners' goals and objectives aligned with the course's goals and outcomes?
- Frequent mistakes
  - Which types of mistakes need special attention?
  
---
  
## How to carry out formative assessment

---

### The best teachers...
- Constantly monitor what is happening to students as they set about learning, as well as pay attention and investigate whether things are proceeding according to plan and as expected.
- They also question their own methods so they might get better at ensuring that their students learn successfully.

![](https://i.imgur.com/2HuMDL4.png)

---

### It can be done in many different ways
- Asking questions to learners and getting responses orally.
- Asking them to describe the strategy they would adopt to solve a problem.
- Asking them to solve a problem in groups, or individually but in front of the class.
- Using brainstorming and discussions.
- Providing diagnostic questionnaire.
- Providing MCQs with distractors.

---

## Formative assessment should be frequent

- Ideally every 5 min
- At least gni 10-15 min
- Attention span: 10-15 min 
- Refocus attention

![](https://i.imgur.com/bvNsKj0.png)

---

### Systematic immediate feedback

- When?
  - Ideally at natural breakpoints such as ending an exercise, shifting to a different subject and right after a wrap-up session.
- How?
  - It should be very focused and expedite in execution. The instructor should think of a clearly stated question that has a binary (Yes/no) or garaded (0-5) response.
  
This is Instant Feedback.

---

### Feedback from learners

- Assessing learner reactions to teachers and teaching thus providing context-specific feedback that can improve teaching within a particular course.
- Assessing learner reactions to class activities, assignments, and materials thus giving instructors information that will help them improve their course materials and assignments.
- Assessing learner reactions to course organisational aspects, thus providing the organiser information that will help him or her to improve the course organisation;

## Feedback is hard

![](https://i.imgur.com/d6WF7T7.png)

---

### Dealing with (bad) feedback

Trainees feedback should be considered along other forms of quality evidence:
- Review what they have effectively learned (in exams)
- Consider your own experience of teaching
- Discuss with colleagues and friends
- Look at the feedback from past sessions of the same course
- Look at the response rates
- Look at the counter examples (contradictions)
- Look at the repetitive patterns (not at only one single answer)
- Breathe deeply
- Humans focus more on negative feedback than on positive (you are not alone)
- Try to see the point in the criticism, learn from it
- Don’t take it personally (easier said than done). Try to focus on what they say about what you do (not who you are)

### Learn and teach others how to give good feedback
