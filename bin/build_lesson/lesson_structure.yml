# ------------ SUMMARY ----------------
# -------------------------------------
# This yaml file defines some of the structure of the entire lesson (titles of each episode,
# their order, and session they belong to).
# The 'lesson_build_wf.yml' workflow file calls the 'structure_lesson.py' python script, which
# sorts the markdown files in the '_episodes' folder according to the structure defined below.
# This is achieved by having the 'structure_lesson.py' script write the number of session and
# of the episode (within that session) into the name of the corresponding file in the '_episodes' folder.
# This is done by adding a prefix of the form 'SIEJ-', where I is the session number and J is the episode
# number (within that session).

# ---- Lesson structure ----

# The lesson structure is defined below.
# 'lesson' is a list of lists. The top-level list corresponds to the sessions. Within each session we have a
# list of episodes.
# If you want to add an episode to the '_episodes' folder you should add it here as well, in the correct position
# in the list. Otherwise it won't be recognised or it will be given the wrong 'SIEJ-' prefix.

# The base URL for the slides.
# The reason we call this the "slides_base_url is that it serves as the first part (or base) of the url for each slide.
# Each slide will have a 'slide_number' and it will have a url given by:
