# ------------ SUMMARY ----------------
# -------------------------------------
# This yaml file defines some of the structure of the entire lesson (titles of each episode,
# their order, and section they belong to).
# The 'lesson_build.yml' workflow file calls the 'structure_lesson.py' python script, which
# sorts the markdown files in the '_episodes' folder according to the structure defined below.
# This is achieved by having the 'structure_lesson.py' script write the number of the episode
# into the name of the corresponding file in the '_episodes' folder.
