# Concept map

# Concept map – FAIR principles

_Parking lot		       Question_

# Concept maps – how to use the tool

_Concept maps are graphical tools for organizing and representing knowledge_

_Include concepts and relationships to link concepts_

_Good to start a concept map with a focus question \- context_

_Help to organize knowledge and to structure it_

_Good concept maps are built with iterations and feedback_

_Joseph D\. Novak \, 1972_

# Concept maps in curriculum/lesson/session planning

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">They present  key concepts in a highly concise manner</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">This helps in the teaching plan to measure how much you can cover</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">The hierarchical organization suggests a sequence to cover material</span>

# Challenge - Draw a concept map (10 min)

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Draw a concept map of your topic of interest\, start with a question</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Include 7 \(\+ \- 2\) concepts</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Include relationships and cross\-links between these concepts</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Arrange it in a hierarchical structure with the key concepts on top</span>

# Challenge - Feedback on concept maps (8 min)

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">In a group of 2 exchange concept maps\. Do not explain the map\.</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Write one thing you are confused/not sure about the map</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Write one thing you like/it is clear about the map</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Each person will give and receive two feedbacks:</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Positive and Negative on content</span>

# Content

<span style="color:#7F7F7F"> __Content collection__ </span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Appropriate content to the needs and capabilities of your target audience</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F"> __Content reduction__ </span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">One of the biggest challenges in designing training courses is the reduction of content to the training format\.</span>  <span style="color:#7F7F7F"> __key points\!__ </span>

# Challenge - Delivery planning (3 min)

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Think if you want to make your training interactive</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Think whether you need or want to use a visual support \(images\)</span>

<span style="color:#7F7F7F">Think whether you need t</span>  _o distribute material in advance to the audience_

_Prepare for your choices_

_Be creative\!_

# Challenge 5 - Prepare content (15 min)

_You have 15 min to prepare the content of your mini\-training_

_The structure of your mini\-training should be something like_

_40 seconds_  _introduction_

_2 minutes on_  _topic_

_20 seconds_  _conclusion_

_Use your concept map and adapt as needed_

# Challenge 6 - Mini-training practice (20 min)

_Split into groups of 3_

_Each will deliver their 3 minute session to the others_

_One person delivers the session_

_One person records on the phone \(optional\)_

_One person notes down feedback in real\-time_

_You describe your own feedback \(self\-feedback\) on your delivery_

_The other two provide feedback to the presenter_

_Then rotate within the group \(and restart from 1\)_

How to give feedback?

# Constructive feedback

# Discussions / feedback

_Listen actively and attentively_

_Ask for clarification if you are confused_

_Do not interrupt one another_

_Challenge one another\, but do so respectfully_

_Critique ideas\, not people_

_Do not offer opinions without supporting evidence_

_Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion_

_Build on one another ’s comments; work toward shared understanding\._

_Do not_  _monopolise_  _discussion\._

_Speak from your own experience\, without generalizing\._

_If you are offended by anything said during discussion\, acknowledge it immediately\._

Select  or identify LOs

Identify/develop _assessments_ to ensure learner is progressing towards LOs

Select _content_ that is relevant to LOs

# From session to course – defining the aim

* Combine the __who__ \, __what__ and __why__ requirements into a __course aim__
  * __Who:__ write clear trainee specifications;
    * _e\.g\._ undergraduate biologists with basic knowledge of Unix and R
  * __What & why:__ describe what trainees will learn\, and the benefit of that
* Consider the __where__ and __when__ requirements \( _i_ \. _e_ \. the logistics\)
  * How much can you do in the time available \(including tests\, feedback\)
  * Resources limitations \(space\, equipment\, assistants\)

# From learning outcomes to a course outline

* A well\-written course aim will guide the generation of LOs
* LOs should then be instantiated as activities and quality checks
  * __Learning activities__ : scripts\, slides\, exercises\, tutorials\, …
  * __Assessment tools:__ creative activities\, written tests\, …
  * __Feedback tools:__ observation\, interaction\, forms\, …
* Learning activities \(LAs\) should be tightly\-linked to quality checks
  * This is not ‘teaching to the test’ because it’s training not education
* When all the LOs are expanded\, you have your course outline
