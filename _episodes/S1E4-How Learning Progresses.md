## How does learning progress?

## Bloom's taxonomy

### Bloom's six categories of cognitive skills

### Using Bloom's taxonomy

Bloom's taxonomy can be helpful in aligning the training with the learners' level of thinking (complexity, experience, etc).

In practice, Bloom's level of cognitive complexity can be used to:

- Write learning outcomes (LOs)
- Design instruction and learning experiences
- Assess learning

## Instruction design in five steps

## Learning outcomes (LOs)

LOs (more accurately “desired LOs”) are statements of what you might (in principle) assess. 

You may not end up assessing all of them, but they are statements of what a successful* student will know or be able to do at the end of instruction.

By the end of the lesson (session/course/instruction) the successful learner will be able to.........

### Writing learning outcomes using assessable verbs

1. Think about what learners will be able to do by the end of instruction
2. Use the sentence:
    - By the end of the lesson (session/course/instruction) the successful learner will be able to......... 
3. Replace dots with a verb that you can assess (name, explain, solve, distinguish, etc.).
4. Avoid verbs that are open to many interpretations: e.g., appreciate, have faith in, know, learn, understand, believe


> ## Challenge: How do I write LOs?
>
> 1. Think of a lesson/session you usually deliver 
> 2. Write one or more Learning Outcomes for the lesson/session
> 3. Write to the GDoc the title of the lesson/session and the corresponding LO(s)
