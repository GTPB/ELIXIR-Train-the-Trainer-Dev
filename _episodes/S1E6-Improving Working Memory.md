title: S1E6-Improving Working Memory

---


## What can we do to make more room in working memory?

- Chunking
- Increase background knowledge
- Avoid extraneous cognitive load

## Increasing background knowledge

Principle **P1**: Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

## How does learning progress?

### The Dreyfus model of skill acquisition


### The Carpentries model of skill acquisition


## Mental models

Mental model - A collection of concepts and facts, along with the relationships between those concepts, that a person has about a topic or field.

Example: mental model of DNA

### Novice vs Competent Practitioner vs Expert

A novice, typically has not yet built a mental model of the field.

A competent practitioner has a mental model that works for many purposes, but will not be very accurate.

Experts’ mental models are much more densely connected. Therefore they can jump directly from a problem to its solution because there is a direct link between the two in their mind.


## What facilitates learning?

- It is not only a matter of knowledge
- Help novices build a mental model
- Help learners make connections
- Detect and remedy misconceptions
- Be aware of the limitations of expertise
  - Expert blind spot
  - Fluid representations
  
### Three classes of misconceptions

1. **Simple factual errors**: These are the easiest to correct.

2. **Broken models**: We can address these by having learners reason through examples to see contradictions.

3. **Fundamental beliefs**: These beliefs are deeply connected to the learner’s social identity and are the hardest to change.


### Cognitive load

1. **Intrinsic cognitive load** is the effort associated with a specific topic.

2. **Germane cognitive load** it is the (desirable) mental effort required to create linkages between new information and old.

2. **Extraneous cognitive load** is everything else that distracts or gets in the way. Extraneous cognitive load refers to the way information or tasks are presented to a learner.


### Attention split effect

Split-attention occurs when learners are required to split their attention between at least two sources of information that have been separated either spatially or temporally.


## Challenge: Extraneous cognitive load (10 min)

- Think of the tasks you teach in your lessons/courses. Pick one.

- What would be the extraneous load in performing this task. How can you avoid it?

- Discuss with your partner(s).
