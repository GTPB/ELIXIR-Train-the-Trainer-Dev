# Episode-Editing Guide

This is a guide for anyone who wants to edit these episodes. The reason for having such a guide is that, unlike other repositories, the episode files in this folder might undergo some extra automatic transformations after each edit/commit. They are also meant to be used both by GitHub Pages and HackMD, which requires some extra care with the formatting.

Below you will find a careful explanation of how to edit each file. If you want to dig a bit deeper and better understand some of the transformations that the files might undergo, as well as the scripts that execute them, you can check these links:

The links take you to the **.github/workflows** folder and to the  **bin/build_lesson**folder, respectively. Both of them are folders in this repository.
