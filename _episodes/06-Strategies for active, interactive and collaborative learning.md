## Active learning
> Learners who actively engage with course materials will end up retaining it for much longer than they would have otherwise, and they will be better able to apply their knowledge broadly.

_Waldrop, Nature 2015_

## Interactive learning
- Participatory engagement 
- Promotes retention
- Develops critical thinking
- Allows you to assess learners
- Learners immediately apply content

## Strategies for active, interactive, collaborative learning
- Brief question-and-answer sessions 
- Think, pair, share
- Shared notes
- Work in groups
- Peer instruction
- Discussions (may be integrated into lectures)
- Brainstorming
- Impromptu writing assignments
- Hands-on activities
- Experiential learning events
- Establish teamwork by agreement
- Introduce blended multimedia materials
- Instant feedback
- Let learners do recaps
- Introduce physical exercises
- Introduce short, relaxing breaks
- Assign tasks/problems to groups/pairs, giving them time to present their results
- Introduce challenges or games


## Activities and attitudes the instructor should promote
- Listening
- Questions asking
- Group discussions/brainstorming
- Peer instruction 
- Participants' interaction/networking
- Presentations by participants
- Mode/pace/activity frequent change




## Activities and attitudes the instructor should avoid or keep to a minimum
- Unidirectional lecturing
- Individual work out with no feedback
- Providing answers before letting participants doing it
- Keeping the same pace for long time
- Using a monotone modality of content delivery (including the tone of the voice)
- Showing no enthusiasm


## Technique - Wrap-up
Allow time for wrap up and feedback


> ## Challenge 9
> On the GDoc
> 
> One or more new things that you have learned today and could be useful for your future teaching/training
{: .challenge}

> ## Challenge 10 - your vote counts
> Add a + sign next to the point you agree the most
>
> :D - Great I feel Iâ€™m learning new things
> :] - I feel neutral, maybe I need more time to reflect
> :S - I am more confused then ever
{: .challenge}


## Technique - Short feedback
- Sticky notes: red and green
- Minute cards: positive and negative (anonymous)
- One up, one down: positive and negative (no repetition)




> ## Challenge 11 - One up one down
>  
> 1. Something you liked about what you did (do this again!)
> 2. Something you would like to change (avoid next time)
{: .challenge}
