## Learning theory

There is no universal theory of learning, but evidence-based research results support some learning principles, which are today accepted and applied.

## 7 evidence-based learning principles

#### Principle P1:
Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

#### Principle P2:
How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

#### Principle P3:
Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn.

#### Principle P4:
To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.

#### Principle P5:
Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning.

#### Principle P6:
Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.

#### Principle P7:
To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.
