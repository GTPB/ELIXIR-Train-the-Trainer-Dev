  + money
  + material goods
  + an interesting career
  + a high-status job, etc.)

- positive outcomes expectancies for success
- growth vs fixed mindset  
- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997). 
- In order to hold a positive expectancy for success, learners must not only believe that doing the assigned work can earn a passing grade (growth mindset), they must also believe that they are capable of doing the work necessary to earn a passing grade



## Environment
- complex dynamics of the classroom 
- its tone 
- the interpersonal forces at play 
- the nature and structure of communication patterns. 
- e.g. "The instructor is approachable and several of my classmates seem willing to help me if I run into troubles". 
- inclusivity
