- "Introduction - Design and plan session, course, materials"
- "Design of a Mini-Training"
- "From Lesson to Session Plan"
- "From Lesson to Course Planning"
- "Wrap-up - Design and plan session, course, materials"

## Session Objectives
- Learn how to design a course.


## Session Learning Outcomes
Design and prepare a 3-minute minitraining

Prepare and plan for delivering training 
Revise feedback 
Adjust/improve/modify (according to feedback) for a 3-minute presentation

## Challenge - define the audience, goal and outcomes (7 min)

Choose a topic
Define learning objectives (describe the goals and intentions of the instructor )
Write learning outcomes (think about what learners will be able to do by the end of instruction/session/workshop)
Identify the target audience and prerequisites
Identify the learning experiences
Select the content

Choose a topic  for a three-minute training

Choose a topic to demonstrate your training in three minutes. 
how to make an origami bird
introduction to biochemistry
how bats recognise the presence of obstacles
the second law of Newton
how to draw a comic strip



Concept map

Concept map - FAIR principles
Parking lot?
What is this supposed to look like?


Concept maps - how to use the tool
Concept maps are graphical tools for organizing and representing knowledge
Include concepts and relationships to link concepts
Good to start a concept map with a focus question - context
Help to organize knowledge and to structure it
Good concept maps are built with iterations and feedback
