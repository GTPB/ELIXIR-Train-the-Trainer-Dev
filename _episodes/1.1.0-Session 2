### Challenge 2
In pairs (3 min)

What makes a good trainer?
Associate some characteristics and describe them


### Example



### The GOBLET skills matrix for trainers



#### Challenge
- Try to reflect on your current skills and how they fit with this matrix
  + Communication (C)
  + Expertise and knowledge (EK)
  + Planning and Management (PM)
  + Learner engagement (LE)
- Then share your thoughts with us



### 7 Evidence-Based Learning Principles

#### Principle P1: Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

#### Principle P2: How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

#### Principle P3: Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn.

#### Principle P4: To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.

#### Principle P5: Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning.

#### Principle P6: Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.

#### Principle P7: To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.


### Challenge - How do you understand principles of learning?

- Work in groups of three
- Carefully read the principles as a group
- Pick one principle you like (with no overlap with the other groups)
- Discuss what you would do as a teacher/instructor to facilitate learning according to the principle

##### Example

Principle 2: How students organiseknowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

Possible teaching practices:
1) Teach learners how to build and use concept maps
2) Provide learners with a scheme and show them how every new concept/fact fits into the scheme
3) every time a new concept/fact is ontroduced, explain how it fits into the general picture


## Motivation and demotivation




### Challenge - Motivation
Think about a motivating experience in your life (as a student or as an instructor/teacher) and share it in the GDoc



### Value
- attainment value
  + satisfaction that one gains from mastery and accomplishment of a goal or task 
- intrinsic value
  + the satisfaction that one gains simply from doing the task rather than from a particular outcome of the task
  + It is the source of intrinsic motivation
- instrumental value/extrinsic rewards 
  + praise
  + public recognition
  + money
  + material goods
  + an interesting career
  + a high-status job, etc.) 


### Efficacy
- positive outcomes expectancies for success
- growth vs fixed mindset  
- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997). 
- positive outcomes expectancies for success
- growth vs fixed mindset  
- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997). 
- In order to hold a positive expectancy for success, learners must not only believe that doing the assigned work can earn a passing grade (growth mindset), they must also believe that they are capable of doing the work necessary to earn a passing grade



### Environment
- complex dynamics of the classroom 
- its tone 
- the interpersonal forces at play 
- the nature and structure of communication patterns. 
- e.g. "The instructor is approachable and several of my classmates seem willing to help me if I run into troubles". 
- inclusivity



### Challenge - What can I do to create a motivating environment?
Think, pair, share
In pairs, think about what you could do to create a motivating environment in your classroom. 
Share it with us.


### Strategies to motivate learners
- Connect the material to students’ interests
- Provide authentic, real-world tasks/example
- Show relevance to students’ current academic lives
- Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students’ future professional lives
- Identify and reward what you value
- Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline
- Build positive expectations
- Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies
- Identify an appropriate level of challenge
- Provide early success opportunities
- Articulate your expectations
- Provide targeted feedback
- Be fair
- Describe effective study strategies
- Give students an opportunity to reflect



### Challenge - Demotivation
Think about a demotivating experience in your life (as a student or as an instructor/teacher) and share it to the GDoc



### Demotivating
Do not
  - Dive into complex or detailed technical discussions with one or two people
  - Pretend to know more than what you do
  - Use diminishing language "just", "simply", "obviously", "don’t you know?"
  - Hinder autonomy
  - Deliver long unidirectional lectures



## Strategies for active, interactive, collaborative learning




### Active learning
Learners who actively engage with course materials will end up retaining it for much longer than they would have otherwise, and they will be better able to apply their knowledge broadly. 



### Interactive learning
- Participatory engagement 
- Promotes retention
- Develops critical thinking
- Allows you to assess learners
- Learners immediately apply content

### Strategies for active, interactive, collaborative learning
- brief question-and-answer sessions 
- think, pair, share
- shared notes
- work in groups
- peer instruction
- discussions (may be integrated into lectures)
- brainstorming
- impromptu writing assignments
- hands-on activities
- experiential learning events
- Establish teamwork by agreement
- Introduce blended multimedia materials
- Instant feedback
- Let learners do recaps
- Introduce physical exercises
- Introduce short, relaxing breaks
- Assign tasks/problems to groups/pairs, giving them time to present their results
- Introduce challenges or games


### Activities and attitudes the instructor should promote
- listening
- questions asking
- group discussions/brainstorming
- peer instruction 
- participants' interaction/networking
- presentations by participants
- mode/pace/activity frequent change




### Activities and attitudes the instructor should avoid or keep to a minimum
- unidirectional lecturing
- individual work out with no feedback
- providing answers before letting participants doing it
- keeping the same pace for long time
- using a monotone modality of content delivery (including the tone of the voice)
- showing no enthusiasm


### Technique - Wrap-up
Allow time for wrap up and feedback


### Challenge
On the GDoc

One or more new things that you have learned today and could be useful for your future teaching/training


### Challenge - your vote counts
Add a + sign next to the point you agree the most

:D - Great I feel I’m learning new things
:] - I feel neutral, maybe I need more time to reflect
:S - I am more confused then ever



### Technique - Short feedback
- Sticky notes: red and green
- Minute cards: positive and negative (anonymous)
- One up, one down: positive and negative (no repetition)




### Challenge 7
One up one down 
1. Something you liked about what you did (do this again!)
2. Something you would like to change (avoid next time)



# Time to relax

### Challenge 6
In pairs ( 10 min)

One person will explain a topic for 90 seconds, while the other person write feedback about presentation and content.
Then you have a minute to go through the feedback.
Then switch and repeat. 

As group (10 min )
  We will go through the feedback together


“Our curiosity is provoked
when we perceive a problem 
that we believe we can solve”




### The learning environment

- Motivation and demotivation
- Mindset

### The seven principles of learning
Jossey Bass based on Ambrose, Susan A., et al. How Learning Works
https://extend.ecampusontario.ca/teacher-for-learning-how-learning-works/



1. Prior knowledge
2. Knowledge organisation
3. Motivation
4. Mastery: acquisition, practice integration, application
5. Goal directed practice with targeted feedback
6. Environment: social, emotional, and intellectual 
7. Self-directed learners: learn, monitor, adjust

Ambrose, Susan A., et al. How Learning Works, John Wiley & Sons, Incorporated, 2010.



### Strategies applied to learning principles
1. Collect data about students and use it to design instruction (P1,P3)

Be aware and make people aware of diversity in the classroom

2. Be explicit about learning goals, learning objectives and expectations (P3, P5, P6)

Goals challenging but attainable

3. Scaffold complex tasks (P2-P7).
Teach and test at the right level, think about your audience

4. Let learners formulate solutions before moving to work on new problems

Have them reflect on what they learned, and what they will do differently in the future (P2, P4, P7)

5. Establish a supportive class climate (P3, P6). 

Learn and use learners' names and encourage them to interact with you in and outside of the course. 

Collect anonymous learner feedback and investigate and respond to any complaints related to class climate.


### Exercise reading
Let’s take 15 min to read about the seven learning principles from the book 
How learning works
