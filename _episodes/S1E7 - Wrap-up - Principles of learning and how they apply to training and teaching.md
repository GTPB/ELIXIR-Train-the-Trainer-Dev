## Other factors facilitating memory and learning (Willingham, 2009)

1. Things that create an emotional reaction will be better remembered, but emotion is not necessary for learning (and it is definitely not sufficient!).
2. If you don't pay attention to something, you can't learn it.
3. Repetition helps but repetition alone is not sufficient.
4. Wanting to remember something has little or no effect.
5. Thinking about meaning is good for memory.
6. Practice makes learning long lasting.
7. Spaced practice is of great benefit for memory.
