_Learning outcomes_

Describe the differences between formative and summative assessment

Tell why frequent feedback is important

# Q: what are the different ways we can categorise assessment?

assess prior knowledge/ mental model\(s\)

verify the target audience

at the beginning of the course

assess prior knowledge/ mental model\(s\)

verify the target audience

at the beginning of the course

assess prior knowledge/ mental model\(s\)

assess whether learning is occurring

verify the target audience

at the beginning of the course

assess prior knowledge/ mental model\(s\)

assess whether learning is occurring

assess if learning has occurred

verify the target audience

at the beginning of the course

assess prior knowledge/ mental model\(s\)

assess whether learning is occurring

assess if learning has occurred

measure the quality\, adequacy\, and impact of the course

Long term feedback

# Assessment timeline - when and why to assess

__Pre\-course assessment__ \(before the course\) \- verify the target audience of the course

__Preventive assessment__ \(beginning of the course\) \- final adjustments of the course to the reality of the participants

__Formative assessment__ \(during the course\) \- pilot in real time if learning is taking place

__Summative assessment__ \(right after the course\) \- measure and evaluate the knowledge and skills acquired

__Strategic evaluation__ \(after the course\, long time after the course\) \- measure the adequacy\, quality and impact of the course

# Pre-course assessment - Diagnostic questionnaires

__Anonymous questionnaires__ allow to have an idea of the level of knowledge of the whole group of learners\.

__Non\-anonymous__ and personal questionnaires allow to find out if the learner has a necessary pre\-required knowledge\, and in the negative case indicate an appropriate teaching choice to palliate this lack\.

# Challenge (2 min)

Think about the questionnaire you filled when you registered to this course\.

What is the role of this questionnaire?

# Who would feel comfortable with giving a definition of «formative assessment»?

# Formative assessment

takes place __during__ teaching and learning\. Its purpose is to help both instructors and learners to become aware of what the focus should be\.

its purpose is to __improve the quality of student learning__ \, _not_ to provide evidence for evaluating or grading students\.

<img src="img/session4-paris-february20202.tiff" width=500px />

can be used to collect information about learners':

prior knowledge

> which knowledge gaps need to be filled before moving on

can be used to collect information about learners':

mental models

> whether their mental models are correct

can be used to collect information about learners':

goals and objectives

> if learners goals and objectives are aligned to the course's goals and outcomes

can be used to collect information about learners':

frequent mistakes

> which types of mistakes need special attention

# Formative Assesment can be used to:

Activate and explore prior knowledge:

activate prior knowledge

reveal accurate but insufficient prior knowledge

recognise inappropriate prior knowledge

highlight inaccurate prior knowledge

Formative assessment allows learners to identify their strengths and weaknessess

<img src="img/session4-paris-february20203.tiff" width=500px />

In other words…\. to assess their own learning

Formative assassment allows teachers to monitor learning and detect learners difficulties

<img src="img/session4-paris-february20204.tiff" width=500px />

And\, as a consequence\, to tune/adapt/modify teaching

<img src="img/session4-paris-february20205.tiff" width=500px />

constantly monitor what is happening to students as they set about learning and investigate when things do not proceed as planned or expected\.

They also inquire their own practice so they might get better at ensuring that their students learn successfully\.

# Reflective practice

<span style="color:#595959">Practice in which learners repeat similar things but in a slightly different way \(repetition vs reflective practice\)</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Practice in which learner AND teacher modify their behaviour as a response to feedback</span>

# Fist of five feedback

<img src="img/session4-paris-february202020.tiff" width=299px />

__Formative assessment should be frequent__

<span style="color:#595959">Ideally every 5 min</span>

<span style="color:#595959">At least gni 10\-15 min</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Attention span: 10\-15 min</span>

<span style="color:#595959">Refocus attention</span>

<img src="img/session4-paris-february202021.jpg" width=480px />

# Systematic immediate feedback

__When?__

Ideally at natural breakpoints such as ending an exercise\, shifting to a different subject and right after a wrap\-up session\.

__How?__

It should be very focused and expedite in execution\. The instructor should think of a clearly stated question that has a binary \(Yes/no\) or garaded \(0\-5\) response\.

This is __Instant Feedback__ \.

# Challenge: benefits of Instant Feedback (5 min)

What are the benefits of instant feedback:

for learners

for trainers

write them down\, one benefit per post\-it

# Feedback from learners

assessing __learner reactions to teachers and teaching__ thus providing context\-specific feedback that can improve teaching within a particular course;

assessing __learner reactions to class activities__ \, assignments\, and materials thus giving instructors information that will help them improve their course materials and assignments;

assessing __learner reactions to course organisational aspects__ \, thus providing the organiser information that will help him or her to improve the course organisation;

<img src="img/session4-paris-february202022.tiff" width=225px />

<img src="img/session4-paris-february202023.tiff" width=170px />

I’ve understood what formative assessment is and I have ideas on how to apply it ib my courses

Not clear how to write learning outcomes

# Short term feedback assessment of training quality,
participant and instructor performance

It happens __immediately at the end of the course__ with the purpose to measure the trainees’ perception of:

the __quality__ of the training and its __organisational aspects__ \,

the __trainer’s capacity__ to teach \(performance\)\,

the __adequacy__ of the training to their expectations

the __strengths and weaknesses__ of course\.

# Challenge (10 min)

Fill in the short term questionnaire for this course

http://bit\.ly/2Xgr3cI

# Task:

Look at Feedback Questionnaires used in ELIXIR workshops\.

The type of questionnaire we developed for ELIXIR Italy courses: Feedback questionnaire for the ELIXIR Italy course on "NGS for evolutionary biologists: from basic scripting to variant calling" \(Rome\, 23\-27 November 2015\)\. It is adapted to each new course\.

The type of questionnaire used to assess the quality of bioinformatics courses organised and delivered by the Gulbenkian Training Programme in Bioinformatics at the Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência: Feedback questionnaire for the course on "Bioinformatics using Python for Biomedical Researchers" \(Oeiras\, PT July 11th – July 15th 2016\)

Common shared questions used by most of the ELIXIR Nodes \(countries\)\.

# Long term post-course feedback

The assessment of impacts that endure\.

__Long term assessments__ \(over 6 months after a course\) __are__ rather __difficult__ \.

# Feedback is hard

<img src="img/session4-paris-february202024.jpg" width=500px />

# Dealing with (bad) feedback

Trainees feedback should be considered along other forms of quality evidence:

Review what they have effectively learned \(in exams\)

Consider your own experience of teaching

Discuss with colleagues and friends

Look at the feedback from past sessions of the same course

Look at the response rates

Look at the counter examples \(contradictions\)

Look at the repetitive patterns \(not at only one single answer\)

__Breath deeply__

Humans focus more on negative feedback than on positive \(you are not alone\)

Try to see the point in the criticism\, __learn from it__

__Don’t take it personally__ \(easier said than done\)\. Try to focus on what they say about what you do \(not who you are\)

# Discussions / feedback

_Listen actively and attentively_

_Ask for clarification if you are confused_

_Do not interrupt one another_

_Challenge one another\, but do so respectfully_

_Critique ideas\, not people_

_Do not offer opinions without supporting evidence_

_Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion_

_Build on one another ’s comments; work toward shared understanding\._

_Do not_  _monopolise_  _discussion\._

_Speak from your own experience\, without generalizing\._

_If you are offended by anything said during discussion\, acknowledge it immediately\._
