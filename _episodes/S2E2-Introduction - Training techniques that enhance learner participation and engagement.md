>### Carpentry teaching practices
>Very effective teaching practices are described in the [Teaching practices lesson] (http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/15-practices/) from the [Software/Data Carpentry Instructor training](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training). 

>Here is a short extract: 

>**Sticky notes**:
We give each learner two sticky notes of different colors, e.g., red and green. These can be held up for voting, but their real use is as status flags. If someone has completed an exercise and wants it checked, they put the green sticky note on their laptop; if they run into a problem and need help, the put up the red one. This is better than having people raise their hands because: 

>* it’s more discreet (which means they’re more likely to actually do it), 
* they can keep working while their flag is raised, and * the instructor can quickly see from the front of the room what state the class is in.


>**Minute cards**:
We also use sticky notes as minute cards: before each coffee or meal break, learners take a minute to write one positive thing on the green sticky note (e.g., one thing they’ve learned that they think will be useful), and one thing they found too fast, too slow, confusing, or irrelevant on the red one. They can use the red sticky note for questions that haven’t yet been answered. It only takes a few minutes to cluster these, and allows the instructors to adjust to learners’ interests and speed.

>**One up, one down**:
We frequently also ask for summary feedback at the end of each day. The instructors ask the learners to alternately give one positive and one negative point about the day, without repeating anything that has already been said. This requirement forces people to say things they otherwise might not: once all the “safe” feedback has been given, participants will start saying what they really think.

>Minute cards are anonymous; the alternating up-and-down feedback is not. Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses, and by providing both, we hope to get the best of both worlds.

> ### Things that an instructor shouldn't do in a course 
> > From: [Motivation - Software/Data Carpentry Instructor training](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/19-motivation/)

> - Tell learners they are rubbish because they use Excel and/or Word don't modularize their code, etc.
> - Repeatedly make digs about Windows and praise Linux, e.g., say that the former is for amateurs.
> - Criticise GUI applications (and by implication their users) and describe command-line tools as the One True Way.
> - Dive into complex or detailed technical discussion with the one or two people in the audience who clearly don't actually need to be there.
> - Pretend to know more than you do. People will actually trust you more if you are frank about the limitations of your knowledge, and will be more likely to ask questions and seek help.
> - Use the J word ("just"). This signals the learner that the instructor thinks their problem is trivial and by extension that they therefore must be stupid for not being able to figure it out.

### The role of wrap-up sessions
At the end of sessions (or a day course, or the whole course), it is important to devote a few minutes to wrap-up and collect feedback.
Wrap-up should be carried out by participants. 
In a course lasting more than one day, the wrap-up of one entire day, can be carried out as the first thing on the day after. The various topics of a day can be assigned to a few participants (it is advised to identify max 4/5 main topics each day and assign each to a different participant), who will stand on the stage before the class and briefly summarise what was done the day before. The instructor may decide to give the participants who have to present a bit of time to reflect and organise a bried speach. 
If you mean to use this type of wrap-up, it is important to inform the participants at the beginning of the course about your intention: many people don't like to be exposed and may feel uncomfortable if not irritated by knowing they have to do something they don't like with short or no notice. 
Usually they accept talking in front of the class if they have time to adapt to this idea *and* you explain them what are their benefits in doing this.

Feedback at the end of each session should be quick and simple. One example approach is the fist of five voting, which is described in the [session on assessment](./TtT_session_4.md).  


## Challenges: discussion

<a name="challenge2">Challenge 2</a>:
> What makes a good trainer? 

> - Knowledge of subject
- Clear aims for session outcomes
- Confidence in delivery
- Appropriate delivery
- Listens to trainees 
- Flexible – can change pace / depth if required
- Approachable
- Engaging

<a name="challenge3">Challenge 3</a>:
>According to experiment described in (Willingham, 2009), effective teachers have two qualities: they are able to connect personally with students, and they organise the material in a way that makes it interesting and easy to understand (the class is well organised).
