## Value
- Attainment value
  + Satisfaction that one gains from mastery and accomplishment of a goal or task 
- Intrinsic value
  + The satisfaction that one gains simply from doing the task rather than from a particular outcome of the task
  + It is the source of intrinsic motivation
- Instrumental value/extrinsic rewards 
  + Praise
  + Public recognition
  + Money
  + Material goods
  + An interesting career
  + A high-status job, etc.) 


## Efficacy
- Positive outcomes expectancies for success
- Growth vs fixed mindset  
- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997).

- Efficacy expetancies represent the belief that one is capable of identifying, organising, initiating, and executing a course of action that will bring about a desired outcome (Bandura, 1997). 
- In order to hold a positive expectancy for success, learners must not only believe that doing the assigned work can earn a passing grade (growth mindset), they must also believe that they are capable of doing the work necessary to earn a passing grade



## Environment
- Complex dynamics of the classroom 
- The tone of the classroom 
- The interpersonal forces at play 
- The nature and structure of communication patterns. 
- E.g. "The instructor is approachable and several of my classmates seem willing to help me if I run into troubles". 
- inclusivity

### Motivation and demotivation

In general terms, as an instructor, if you feel that you need to motivate learners you should stop and think. There must be something wrong. You may be unable to identify the reason but this should be seen as a signal not to continue. You should not need to motivate people that fall in yor hands, but if you do, you should have a strategy in place for that. Start with figuring out the level of the audience and what could grab their interest.

You should identify factors that may demotivate your audience and build plans to avoid them. Factors that relate to delivery format are a particular concern, as they can ruin training that has been carefully built, content-wise. Lengthy lectures, over-crowded slides, lack of materials to follow-up are good examples.

> The lesson on [Motivation and Demotivation](http://swcarpentry.github.io/instructor-training/16-motivation/) from the [Software/Data Carpentry Instructor training](http://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/08-motivation/) is a very interesting reading on the topic. Here is a list of strategies for motivating learners from this lesson:
> 
    Strategies to establish value:
      - Connect the material to students’ interests.
      - Provide authentic, real-world tasks.
      - Show relevance to students’ current academic lives.
      - Demonstrate the relevance of higher-level skills to students’ future professional lives.
      - Identify and reward what you value.
      - Show your own passion and enthusiasm for the discipline.
    Strategies to build positive expectations:
      - Ensure alignment of objectives, assessments, and instructional strategies.
      - Identify an appropriate level of challenge.
      - Create assignments that provide the appropriate level of challenge.
      - Provide early success opportunities.
      - Articulate your expectations.
      - Provide rubrics.
      - Provide targeted feedback.
      - Be fair.
      - Educate students about the ways we explain success and failure.
      - Describe effective study strategies.
    Strategies for self-efficacy:
      - Provide flexibility and control.
      - Give students an opportunity to reflect.

> 

The techniques that can be used to keep motivation up in an audience are called engagement.

Examples of techniques that you can use to promote engagement in training:

* Establish teamwork by agreement
* Introduce blended multi-media materials 
* Make frequent use of instant feedback to monitor and to induce self-assessment
* Offer participatory stimuli (prizes, gamifications)
* Let learners doing recaps (in the morning about the day before, at the end of sessions, etc)
* Introduce physical exercise (e.g. at the beginning of after-lunch sessions): this is good for both physical and mental health
* Introduce short, relaxing breaks (e.g. one minute meditation)
* Assign tasks to groups (e.g. Python libraries) and let the groups present the result of their work
