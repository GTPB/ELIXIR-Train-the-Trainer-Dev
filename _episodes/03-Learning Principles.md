## 7 Evidence-Based Learning Principles

#### Principle P1:
Students' prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.

#### Principle P2:
How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

#### Principle P3:
Students motivation determines, directs and sustains what they do learn.

#### Principle P4:
To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.

#### Principle P5:
Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students' learning.

#### Principle P6:
Students' current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.

#### Principle P7:
To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.


## Challenge - How do you understand principles of learning?

- Work in groups of three
- Carefully read the principles as a group
- Pick one principle you like (with no overlap with the other groups)
- Discuss what you would do as a teacher/instructor to facilitate learning according to the principle

## Example

Principle 2: How students organise knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.

Possible teaching practices:
1) Teach learners how to build and use concept maps
2) Provide learners with a scheme and show them how every new concept/fact fits into the scheme
3) every time a new concept/fact is ontroduced, explain how it fits into the general picture
